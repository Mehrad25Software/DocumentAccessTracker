# JFK DeClassified Document Tracker

## Project Description
--Searching for information on the JFK assassination within thousands of pages of declassified documents can be an incredibly challenging and time-consuming task. The lack of organization, the scattered nature of data, and the complexity of identifying who accessed what information and when makes it nearly impossible for researchers to draw meaningful connections. The JFK DeClassified Document Tracker addresses this issue by providing a centralized, searchable database that organizes 400–500 pages of critical data, including document details, involved departments, individuals, and access dates. By streamlining the process of following threads and uncovering patterns, this application empowers researchers to conduct thorough investigations efficiently and effectively.
